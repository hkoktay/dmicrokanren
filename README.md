# Microkanren implemented with dart

This is the [microkanren](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren) language implemented with dart. This implementation tries to stay close to the original version. There are some differences. There is no pair data structure instead I used the build-in list data structure of dart. Another difference is the abstraction of the Substitution, State and Stream data structures. In the original scheme implementation these data structures where just build-in scheme lists.
